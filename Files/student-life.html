                    <h1>Athletics and Recreation</h1>
                    <p>At Shivapuri Secondary School, physical activity is considered an essential part of student
                        development. We strive to maintain an environment where students not only focus on academics but
                        also actively participate in sports and recreational programs. These activities help build
                        discipline, teamwork, and confidence among students.</p>
                    <h3>School Playground</h3>
                    <p>Our open playground is a lively hub of activity during school hours. It serves as a multipurpose
                        space for games, morning assemblies, PE classes, and casual breaks. Students enjoy playing
                        football, volleyball, badminton, and other traditional games such as karate and chungi. Though
                        modest in size, the playground is used daily and brings great energy to school life.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Annual Sports Week</h3>
                    <div class="image-gallery">
                        <img src="images/sports day1.jpg" alt="Sports Week Competition">

                    </div>
                    <p>One of the most exciting events at our school is the Annual Sports Week. Students from different
                        grades and from different house form teams to compete in various athletic competitions like
                        volleyball, baseketball, football,
                        badminton and cricket. The event promotes healthy competition and unity, and medals
                        and certificates are awarded to winners, making it a cherished memory for all.</p>

                    <h3>Recreational Activities</h3>
                    <p>Besides sports, students are encouraged to join recreational sessions such as group dancing,
                        PT, and singing during club periods or before school events. These creative
                        outlets provide balance and reduce stress, especially during exam seasons. Occasional movie
                        screenings or storytelling sessions also help students unwind and have fun.</p>

                    <h3>Team Representation</h3>
                    <p>Selected students have the opportunity to represent Shivapuri in inter-school sports tournaments
                        organized by local municipalities and education offices. These competitions help our students
                        interact with peers from other schools and boost their confidence and sportsmanship.</p>

                    </div>

                    <p>The health and safety of our students is a top priority at Shivapuri Secondary School. While we
                        may not have a full hospital on campus/school, we maintain essential health services and promote
                        wellness through education and community support.
                    </p>

                    <h3>School Health Room</h3>
                    <p>Our school maintains a simple but effective nurse room equipped with basic first-aid kits and
                        supplies. Minor injuries, sudden illnesses, and health complaints are handled immediately by
                        trained staff. Students who feel unwell during school hours are given initial care, and if
                        necessary, parents are informed and appropriate steps are taken.</p>

                    <h3>Emergency Response</h3>
                    <p>In case of medical emergencies, our teachers and administrative staff are trained to respond
                        quickly and responsibly. We have coordination with the nearest health post, and arrangements are
                        made to transport students if needed. Emergency contact information for every student is safely
                        kept and used when necessary.</p>

                    <h3>Health Education</h3>
                    <p>As part of our curriculum, we provide lessons on personal hygiene, nutrition, mental health, and
                        adolescent development. Special sessions are conducted by visiting health professionals to
                        educate students about common illnesses, menstruation hygiene, and healthy habits. These
                        sessions are especially important for growing students in rural and semi-urban areas.</p>

                    <h3>Awareness Programs</h3>
                    <p>From time to time, health screening programs such as eye-checkups and dental checkups are
                        organized in collaboration with local health volunteers and NGOs. The school also observes
                        important dates like World Health Day with rallies, poster-making, and student-led presentations
                        to spread awareness on health-related topics.</p>

                                    the school premises. This ritual, rooted in centuries-old heritage, promotes
                                    spiritual mindfulness and respect for ancestral customs. Such events give students
                                    the opportunity to engage with Nepal's rich cultural legacy, building awareness and
                                    appreciation of local traditions.
