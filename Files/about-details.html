                        belonging to different socio-economic backgrounds.</p>

                        affiliations with Tribhuvan University (TU). The school is currently enrolling more than 1,350
                        students in its rolls and is served by an extremely dedicated 65-member faculty specialized in
                        various fields.</p>

                    <p>The response unfolds in a campus setting that mirrors across multiple buildings equipped with
                        high-tech classrooms, digital teaching boards, high-speed internet connectivity, a library of
                        more than 10,000 physical and electronic books, and multipurpose auditoria for academic and
                        extracurricular activities. Shivapuri's educational approach is a blend of intensive academic
                        preparation with values-based education focusing on discipline, compassion, and citizenship.</p>

                    <h3>Academic Offerings</h3>

                    <p><strong>+2 Management:</strong> The curriculum is designed to provide students with general and

                    <p>Established in response to Nepal's growing demand for technically competent youth, this stream is
                        equivalent to a Diploma in Computer Engineering. Courses consist of structured programming,
                        computer hardware maintenance and networking, and software design. Entrance is based on merit
                        and personal motivation to encourage academic excellence and career focus.</p>

                        boards, virtual labs, and hybrid models of learning has put it on the cutting edge of public
                        school education. Regular updation of the IT infrastructure ensures teachers and students remain
                        digitally equipped and globally competitive.</p>

                    <p>The institution has been formally granted the title of a model school by Kathmandu Metropolitan

                <!-- History -->
                <div id="history" class="content-section">
                    <h1>History</h1>

                    <h3>Founding & Early Challenges (1948–2010)</h3>
                    <p>Shivapuri's history is firmly rooted in Nepal's post-Rana democratic renaissance. It was
                        established as a neighborhood community school by local educators, social reformers, and
                        philanthropists and emerged as a symbol of educational transformation at a time when access to
                        schools was strictly restricted, especially for marginalized sections of society.</p>

                    <p>In its early years, the school operated in rented buildings using volunteer teachers and limited
                        infrastructure. Despite adversity, including opposition to formal schooling and lack of
                        infrastructure, the school grew incrementally driven by community commitment and sponsorship
                        from grassroots organizations.</p>

                    <p>The initial attempts at initiating a technical stream were brought about by the approval of the
                        curriculum, teachers' availability, and equipment purchase. Despite this, through collaborations
                        with Kathmandu Metropolitan City and donor support schemes from abroad, Shivapuri was laying the
                        groundwork for further growth in future years.</p>

                    <h3>Growth & Modernization (2010–Present)</h3>
                    <p>Shivapuri established Shivapuri College in 2010 due to alumni proposals and growing demand for
                        access to higher education within the area, initiating the TU-affiliated BBS program. It was a
                        transition from being a school to a composite institution offering secondary and tertiary
                        education under one umbrella.</p>

                    <p>Shivapuri, in 2015, became one of the very first community schools in Nepal to introduce a
                        Computer Engineering stream in Grades 9–12. The curriculum for the technical streams was
                        developed in consultation with IT professionals and TU advisors to make it relevant and
                        challenging.</p>

                    <p>In the 2020s, Shivapuri made expansion plans to include new schools of Hotel Management,
                        Information Technology, and Tourism that align with Nepal's emerging sectors of the economy. It
                        also invested in e-learning modules, and smart classrooms and digital attendance systems to
                        modernize administrative efficiency.</p>

                    <h3>Alumni Legacy</h3>
                    <p>Shivapuri boasts an illustrious legacy of alumni who have left their mark on numerous sectors.
                        Some prominent alumni include:</p>
